### Description

This project is a simple raycaster to simulate 3d rooms, like in the old Wolfenstein 3D game.

We used the school graphical library: the MiniLibX for doing the graphical stuff. (Linux only)

### Features of the game:

  1. W, A, S and D keys to move the player

  2. Right and left arrow key to rotate the perspective of the player

  3. Collisions

  4. An simple minimap

  5. Esc key to exit the game

  6. Build your own map (see the right format in subject.pdf)
